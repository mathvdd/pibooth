The fan is controlled by a python script reading the temperature sensor of the RPi and a 2N3904 NPN transistor.

Layout:

    RPi pin 4 (GND) to transistor emitter
    RPi pin 6 (GPIO 14) to 1kOhm resistor to transistor base
    Fan negative to transistor collector
    Fan positive to RPi pin 2 (5V)

The python script (fancontrol.py) is originally from here: https://howchoo.com/g/ote2mjkzzta/control-raspberry-pi-fan-temperature-python

Add the following line to /etc/rc.local just before exit 0 for launching fancontrol.py at boot:

    python /home/USERNAME/Raspmaton/fancontrol.py &

sudo reboot

some more commands

File transfert over ssh with scp:

scp /PATH/TO/FILE/fancontrol.py USERNAME@IP_ADRESS:fancontrol.py

Reading the temperature of the RPi from bash:

/usr/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp

See if the process is active after startup:

ps aux | grep fan
